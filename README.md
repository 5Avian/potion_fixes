# Potion Fixes

[![Requires Fabric API](https://i.imgur.com/Ol1Tcf8.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)

Potion Fixes fixes a few issues with potion-related systems.

- The potion slots of the Brewing Stand can now contain any Potion Type
- Dispensers and Brewing Stands now support potions with a higher max stack size than 1

This mod has no effect on the game by itself.
It is intended to be used alongside a stack size changing mod or as a dependency for other mods.
